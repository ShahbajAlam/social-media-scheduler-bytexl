## Key Changes

### 1. **Centralized Post Rendering**

-   Introduced a centralized `renderPosts()` function that is responsible for generating and displaying all scheduled posts. Instead of manipulating the DOM directly each time a post is added, edited, or deleted, the entire list is re-rendered based on the current `scheduledPosts` state.

### 2. **Removal of Manual DOM Manipulation**

-   Replaced the previous manual `createElement` and `appendChild` method of adding and deleting posts with a more declarative rendering approach.
-   The UI now reflects the current state of `scheduledPosts` seamlessly by calling `renderPosts()` when necessary.

### 3. **Use of Template Literals for Post Creation**

-   Instead of using `createElement` and `appendChild` for each post's DOM structure, template literals are used to generate the post HTML structure. This simplifies the code and enhances readability while reducing the complexity of the code.

### 4. **Automatic UI Updates**

-   The application now automatically re-renders the list of posts whenever changes are made (e.g., adding, deleting, or updating a post).
-   After each state change, the DOM is updated with the latest list of posts, ensuring that the UI always reflects the actual data in `scheduledPosts`.
