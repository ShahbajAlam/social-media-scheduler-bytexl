## Component Structure for Social Media Scheduler App

### Overview

To make the application more readable, reusable, and maintainable, we refactored the original `App.jsx` into smaller functional components. These components represent logical and visual sections of the UI.

---

### Why Split the App?

Large React components can become hard to read and manage. By dividing the UI into smaller components, we achieve:

-   ✅ **Separation of concerns** – each component handles a specific piece of functionality or UI.
-   🔁 **Reusability** – components like `Header` can be reused across multiple pages if needed.
-   🧹 **Cleaner code** – easier to debug, understand, and extend.
-   🚀 **Scalability** – new features can be added without cluttering one large file.

## 🧱 Component Breakdown

### 1. **Header.jsx**

#### Purpose:

Displays the static page header, including the title and subheading of the app.

#### Why it’s separate:

-   Contains no dynamic logic.
-   Reusable across multiple pages or layouts.
-   Keeps the visual branding isolated from business logic.

---

### 2. **PostForm.jsx**

#### 🔹 Purpose:

This is the form where users create and schedule a new post. It includes fields for:

-   Post title
-   Post content
-   Image upload
-   Platform selection
-   Date and time scheduling

#### 🔹 Why it’s separate:

-   Encapsulates all form-related logic and layout in one place.
-   Future enhancements like validation, form state, or error handling can be managed locally.
-   Keeps form complexity away from the main `App` container.

---

### 3. **PostList.jsx**

#### 🔹 Purpose:

Displays the list of scheduled posts and a message if there are none.

#### 🔹 Why it’s separate:

-   Handles rendering of output from the app logic.
-   Can be enhanced independently to include features like delete, edit, or filtering.
-   Keeps list-related rendering concerns isolated.

### How the App Uses These Components

All JSX was combined in a single file which made it:

-   Difficult to manage
-   Repetitive and hard to test
-   Less intuitive for collaboration

### Refactored `App.jsx` (Structure Example):

```
import Header from "./components/Header";
import PostForm from "./components/PostForm";
import PostList from "./components/PostList";

function App() {
	return (
		<div id="appContainer" className="min-h-screen">
			<Header />
			<div className="content-container">
				 <PostForm />
				 <PostList />
			</div>
		</div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
