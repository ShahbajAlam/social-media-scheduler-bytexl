### Key Changes

1.  **Proxy Implementation**:

    -   We wrapped the `scheduledPosts` state array with a `Proxy`. This allowed us to intercept changes to the state and perform additional actions (such as updating the UI) automatically.
    -   The `Proxy` was set up to listen for specific operations on the state (like adding or removing posts) and trigger UI updates each time the state changes.

2.  **Automatic UI Update**:

    -   Whenever a post is added to or removed from the state, the `Proxy` automatically triggers a function that updates the UI (`updatePostsList()`). This means that the UI is always updated without requiring additional function calls scattered throughout the code.
    -   The UI no longer relies on explicit calls to `updatePostsList()` after each change, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and improving maintainability.

3.  **Improved Code Readability**:

    -   The `Proxy` abstracts away the manual management of state changes. This results in cleaner, more readable code that is easier to maintain and scale.
    -   With the `Proxy`, state management becomes more declarative, and we don't have to worry about remembering to manually trigger UI updates after every change.

4.  **Error Prevention**:

    -   By using the `Proxy`, we ensured that every modification to the state automatically triggers the necessary UI update. This eliminates the risk of missing UI updates and ensures the state is always accurately reflected in the interface.

## Benefits of the Proxy Implementation

-   **Automatic Synchronization**: The state and the UI are now always synchronized automatically. Any change to the state results in an immediate update to the UI without any additional manual effort.
-   **Reduced Redundancy**: We removed repetitive code, as the `Proxy` automatically takes care of updating the UI when the state changes.
-   **Cleaner and More Maintainable Code**: With the `Proxy`, state management becomes more declarative and easier to follow, reducing the chance of errors and making the codebase more maintainable.
-   **Scalability**: The solution is scalable. As the project grows and the complexity of the state management increases, using a `Proxy` will help manage changes to the state more efficiently.

## Conclusion

By introducing the `Proxy` object, we optimized the state management in the Social Media Scheduler project. This change improved the maintainability of the code, reduced redundancy, and ensured that the UI is always in sync with the state. The use of `Proxy` allows for automatic handling of state modifications, leading to cleaner code and a more efficient workflow.
