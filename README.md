## Changes Made

### 1. **Modularization**

The original `createPostElement` function has been refactored into smaller, dedicated helper functions. Each helper function is now responsible for creating a specific part of the post element. This makes the code more organized and reusable.

### 2. **Helper Functions Created**

-   **`createPostElement(post)`**:

    -   This is the main function that assembles the complete post card element. It calls the other helper functions to build the post card from its parts.

-   **`createPostHeader(post)`**:

    -   This function is responsible for creating the header section of the post. It includes the post title and scheduled date.
    -   It returns the header element that will be appended to the main post card.

-   **`createPostContent(post)`**:

    -   This function creates the content section of the post, including the text content that the post contains.
    -   It returns the content element.

-   **`createPostImage(post)`**:

    -   This function creates the image section if a post has an image. If there is no image in the post data, it returns `null`.
    -   It returns the image element or `null` if no image is provided.

-   **`createPostPlatforms(post)`**:

    -   This function creates the platform tags for each platform specified in the post. It generates tags with icons for each platform and appends them to the `platforms` container.
    -   It returns the platforms container element.

-   **`createPostActions(post)`**:

    -   This function creates the actions container, which includes the delete button for the post. It also includes the event listener for the delete button, which removes the post from the DOM and calls the `deletePost` function to remove the post from localStorage (or another data source).
    -   It returns the actions container element.
